Framework: Django (Python)

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It provides an ORM, authentication system, and built-in admin interface.
Implementation:

Backend API built with Django REST Framework (DRF) to serve JSON responses to the React frontend.

Models represent hospital entities (patients, doctors, services, billing, claims).

Authentication handled through JWT tokens.

Deployed on PythonAnywhere with automatic synchronization to Supabase.
