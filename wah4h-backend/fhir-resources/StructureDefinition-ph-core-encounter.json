It is based on the [FHIR R4 Encounter](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/encounter.html) resource and identifies the *additional* mandatory core elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets that **SHALL** be present in the Encounter when conforming to this profile. It provides the floor for standards development for specific uses cases in a Philippine context.",
